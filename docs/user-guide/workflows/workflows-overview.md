# Workflows Overview

AI/Run CodeMie allows you to design complex logic for interactions between assistants, enabling the creation of fully functional workflows. By executing a series of actions, users can create their own low-code pipelines to handle a wide variety of tasks.

## Accessing Workflows

Navigate to the **Workflows** tab in the left sidebar:

![Workflows tab in the navigation menu](./images/workflows-overview/workflows-tab-navigation.png)

## Workflow Categories

Workflows are organized into three main categories:

| Category          | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **My Workflows**  | Your personal workflows that you own or manage                                     |
| **All Workflows** | A complete list of workflows available for you to use                              |
| **Templates**     | Ready-made templates for quickly creating and customizing workflows                |
| **Marketplace**   | Globally published workflows discoverable and executable by any authenticated user |

| **Configuration** | Shows the workflow graph, YAML configuration, and sidebar with metadata such as Workflow ID and access links.                 |

### Configuration Tab

#### Workflow Graph

The visual graph displays all states (nodes) and their transitions (edges) in the workflow.

The graph toolbar at the bottom of the graph panel provides the following controls:

| Control          | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+** (Zoom in)  | Increases the zoom level of the graph.                                                                                                          |
| **−** (Zoom out) | Decreases the zoom level of the graph.                                                                                                          |
| **Fit view**     | Automatically scales and repositions the graph so all nodes are visible within the current panel.                                               |
| **Download**     | Saves the current graph view as an image file.                                                                                                  |
| **Expand**       | Expands the graph panel to fill the entire viewport, hiding other page elements for a focused view. To exit, click **Collapse** or press `Esc`. |

:::tip Fullscreen graph view
Use the **Expand** button to view complex workflows in fullscreen mode — especially useful during demos or knowledge-sharing sessions.
:::

#### YAML Configuration

Below the graph, the full YAML configuration of the workflow is displayed in a read-only code block. Use the **Copy** button in the top-right corner of the code block to copy the YAML to your clipboard.

#### Sidebar

The right sidebar displays workflow metadata:

| Field                        | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project**                  | The project this workflow belongs to.                                                     |
| **Workflow ID**              | The unique identifier of this workflow. Click the copy icon to copy it to your clipboard. |
| **Link to workflow details** | A direct URL to this Workflow Details page. Click the copy icon to copy the link.         |

## Starting Workflow in Chat Mode

Launch workflows within a chat interface, preserving conversational context and minimizing context switching. Your chat prompt serves as the initial input for the workflow.

1. Click the **Start Chat** button on the workflow card

   ![Workflow in chat mode](./images/workflows-overview/workflow-chat-interface.png)

2. Enter your prompt in the chat interface

   ![Workflow execution link](./images/workflows-overview/workflow-chat-execution-link.png)

3. The workflow executes with your message as the initial input

4. Monitor progress and view results in the chat

### Opening the Execution Page from Chat

Each workflow response message in chat mode includes an **Open execution page** icon in the message action bar. Click it to open the full workflow execution page for that specific message in a new tab — where you can review execution steps, states, and detailed output.

### Attaching Files in Chat Mode

When running a workflow in chat mode, you can attach up to **10 files** to your message.
**To attach files:**

1. In the chat input area, attach files using any of these methods:
   - Click the **paperclip** icon in the input toolbar to open a file picker
   - Drag and drop files directly into the chat window
2. Each uploaded file appears as a chip with options to preview, download, or remove it.
3. Send your message to start the workflow execution.

![Chat input with multiple files attached before sending](./images/workflows-overview/workflow-chat-file-attachment.png)

After execution completes, you can view the results in the **Workflow Execution History**:

![Workflow execution results showing analysis of multiple attached files](./images/workflows-overview/workflow-execution-multi-file-result.png)

**Supported file types and limits:**

| Parameter     | Value                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Max files     | 10 per execution                    |
| Max file size | 100 MB per file                     |
| File formats  | CSV, PDF, JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, PPTX |

**How files are available in workflow steps:**

Each attached file is appended to the task description of every state:

```
File attached: filename.ext
```

The full list of file names is also accessible via the `{{file_names}}` context variable in YAML task templates or tool arguments.

:::tip Referencing a specific file
Mention a file by name (e.g., `@report.pdf`) to direct a step to focus on that specific file rather than processing all attached files.
:::

### Chat History

Workflow chat history works the same way as with regular assistants. You can always review your workflow conversations in the Chats tab that started in a chat mode, where you'll find:

- Recently used workflows
- Recently used assistants

## Starting Workflow in Execution Mode

The standard way to launch a workflow with a dedicated execution interface.

1. Click the **Start Execution** button on the workflow card:

   ![Start Execution button](./images/workflows-overview/start-execution-button.png)

2. Enter your prompt in the New Workflow Execution window:

   ![New Workflow Execution window](./images/workflows-overview/new-execution-window.png)

   The prompt input field may display a hint set by the workflow creator to guide what input is expected.

3. Click **Create** to initiate the execution.

### Monitoring Execution

After starting an execution, you'll be redirected to the Workflow Execution page:

![Workflow Execution page](./images/workflows-overview/workflow-execution-page.png)

### Execution Controls

During execution, you can:

- **View Progress**: Monitor execution status in the **States** tab
- **Rerun**: Restart the workflow execution
- **Abort**: Stop a running execution

![Abort and rerun buttons](./images/workflows-overview/execution-abort-rerun-buttons.png)

:::info
The abort button is only available while the workflow is actively executing.
:::

## Marking Workflows as Favorites

You can mark any workflow as a favorite for quick access. Click the **Favorite** button (star icon) on a workflow card to save it. All favorite workflows are available on the **Favorites** page in the left navigation panel, alongside favorite assistants and skills.

See [Favorites](../assistants/favorites.md) for full details.

![Abort workflow button](./images/workflows-overview/execution-abort-button.png)

### Execution History

All workflow executions are saved in the execution history. Switch between past executions by clicking on them in the history panel:
